# Implementation Summary for timedctl-rs API Enhancements

## Overview

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the timedctl-rs library to achieve full API feature parity with the Python backend. The implementation focused on semantic correctness, proper error handling, comprehensive testing, and adherence to API specifications.

## Enhanced Model Coverage

### New Models Added
- `Attendance` and `AttendanceAttributes` for attendance tracking
- `Absence`, `AbsenceAttributes` and `AbsenceType` for absence management
- Statistical models:
  - `YearStatistic`
  - `MonthStatistic`
  - `TaskStatistic`
  - `UserStatistic`
  - `ProjectStatistic`
  - `CustomerStatistic`
  - `WorkReport`

### Enhanced Existing Models
- Improved `Report` with additional fields (verified, billed, rejected)
- Expanded `FilterParams` with comprehensive query parameters matching backend expectations
- Added proper relationship handling between models

## API Endpoint Coverage

### Core Endpoints
| Endpoint Type | Status | Implemented Functionality |
|---------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Activities | ✅ Complete | CRUD operations with proper filtering |
| Reports | ✅ Complete | CRUD, bulk operations, intersection, export |
| Users | ✅ Complete | User information retrieval |
| Projects | ✅ Complete | Project listing with filtering |
| Tasks | ✅ Complete | Task operations with relationships |
| Customers | ✅ Complete | Customer listing and filtering |
| WorktimeBalances | ✅ Complete | Balance tracking with filtering |

### New Endpoints
| Endpoint Type | Status | Implemented Functionality |
|---------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Attendance | ✅ Complete | CRUD operations for attendance tracking |
| Absence | ✅ Complete | CRUD operations for absence management |
| Statistics | ✅ Complete | All statistics endpoints (Year, Month, Task, User, Customer, Project) |

## Enhanced Query Parameter Support

### Filtering Improvements
- Date filtering enhancements:
  - Support for single date via `date` parameter
  - Date range filtering via `from_date` and `to_date` parameters
  - Automatic today filtering when no date specified
- User filtering across all endpoints (current user vs. all users)
- Task and Project filtering parameters
- Archived status filtering
- Review and billable status parameters

### Include Parameter
- Enhanced include mechanism for proper relationship loading
- Proper parsing of included resources in responses

## Report Functionality

### Basic Operations
- Get reports by date and date range
- Create new reports
- Edit existing reports
- Delete reports

### Advanced Operations
- Bulk update reports with same field values
- Report intersection for finding common values
- Export reports to various formats (CSV, XLSX, ODS)

## Testing Infrastructure

### Unit Tests
- Test coverage for new models serialization/deserialization
- Verification of field naming and relationship mapping
- Validation of filter parameter processing

### Integration Tests
- Mock server tests for API endpoints
- Request/response validation
- Error handling verification

## Error Handling

Enhanced error handling throughout the API client:
- Proper HTTP error status code processing
- Semantic error messages based on backend responses
- Runtime error recovery with appropriate fallbacks

## Future Improvements

While full API coverage has been implemented, several areas could be further enhanced:

1. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement more comprehensive recovery strategies
   - Add better error messages for specific API errors

2. **Pagination Support**
   - Add proper pagination for large result sets
   - Implement cursor-based navigation

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Add intelligent caching for frequently used endpoints
   - Implement request batching for related entities

4. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Extend CLI commands to use the new API endpoints
   - Add proper command-line options for advanced filtering
