# timedctl-rs Migration Status

This document tracks the progress of migrating the Python-based `timedctl` and `libtimed` to Rust.

## Overview

The migration involves creating:
1. A Rust library crate (`lib.rs`) that implements the functionality of `libtimed`
2. A Rust binary crate (`main.rs`) that implements the functionality of `timedctl`

## Architecture Changes

The following changes have been made to improve the architecture:

1. **Authentication Responsibility**:
   - In the Python version, authentication was handled by the library (`libtimed`)
   - In the Rust version, authentication is the responsibility of the CLI (`timedctl-rs` binary)
   - This provides better separation of concerns and more flexibility

2. **Authentication Method**:
   - The Rust implementation only supports Device Flow authentication
   - Browser-based flow has been omitted for ease of migration

## API Endpoint Coverage

| API Endpoint Category | Implemented | Notes |
|----------------------|-------------|-------|
| Activities | ⚠️ Partial | Core operations implemented, needs improved filtering |
| Reports | ⚠️ Partial | Basic operations implemented, missing bulk & export features |
| Users | ⚠️ Partial | Basic user info implemented, missing list all users |
| Projects | ✅ Complete | Project listing with all necessary filters |
| Tasks | ✅ Complete | Task operations with proper relationship handling |
| Customers | ✅ Complete | Customer listing with filtering |
| WorktimeBalances | ✅ Complete | Balance retrieval implemented |
| Attendance | ✅ Complete | Attendance tracking implemented |
| Absence | ✅ Complete | Absence tracking implemented |
| Statistics | ✅ Complete | All statistics endpoints implemented |

See the `API_PROGRESS.md` document for detailed endpoint coverage status and implementation recommendations.

## Future Considerations

- Performance benchmarks comparing Rust vs Python implementations
- Packaging for different platforms (cargo, AUR, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Enhance error handling with more detailed messages
- Add paging support for large result sets
- Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies
